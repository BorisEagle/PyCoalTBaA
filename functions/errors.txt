Thanks for ur work kingarthur - i just can't find recipe for getting 20 nitrogen + 5 oxygen from from bob's compressed air
Recipes for invar, brass and bronze looks like its gone for long time - don't know good that or bad :roll: same with bob's rubber and resin

Wow i saw recipe for hydrogen peroxide from Bob's Revamp mod - i knew that pyanodon erased it to use its own recipe with nickel + anthraquinone lol now it can be used :D

Lol 2 ways to get sodium hydroxide nad only 1 way to get hydrogen peroxide with 4 lamps - oh man i can't stop laughing  :lol:  :D ocuch + 2 additional recipes from PYRO - all 4 recipe for hydrogen chloride associated with PYRO and using some of its elements

Lithium plates can't be used for getting grease and for making Heavy N Dopped Silicon from PYHT strange but okey :)

Niobium, vanadium and molybdenum doesn't requires nitrogen dioxde - strange - okey waiting for update - p.s. may be its politics from pyanodon - he decided not to use nitrogen dioxide at all :?

Bob's carbon has no full use :!: and seems its replaced with coke

Insulated wire don't using in science pack 3 instead of this tinned cable is used

Tinned cable and tinned copper wire is different things but have similar recipes = tinned copper wire - 3 copper cable + 1 tin - and tinned cable is 2 copper cable + 1 tin - don't must they be replaced to each other or not

Ferric chloride solution has only 1 way to be used - module main board - may we need just to replace it to boric acid? And in this recipe phenolic board exist which can be crafted but was overhauled by pyanodon early when PYHT was out

Found 1 bug - https://yadi.sk/i/AgpWU1EkHAEB_Q - MoO3 recipe has double 100 oxygen in requirements - so 10 MoS2 + 100 oxygen + 100 oxygen = 5 MoO3

Found some bugs with new updates PYCP and PYRO when PycoalTBA is installed

1) Bug in recipe for "activated carbon" https://yadi.sk/i/EBxmtVQ9HFxAYA
20 coke + 2 zinc chloride + 4 sodium hydroxide + 7 sodium hydroxide + 100 nitrogen
Can't understand wciich value is correct - 4 sodium hydroxide or 7 sodium hydroxide ?

2) Bug in "Filtration media recipe" https://yadi.sk/i/czWt0H3q4j5F7w
Glass value is doubled - 25 gravel + 30 pure sand + 3 activated carbon + 5 glass + 5 glass
