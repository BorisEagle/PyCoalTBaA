	--((Science and tech changes))--

make early game sample analizer. see if i can borrow angels basic lab if industries isnt coming back soonish

rename sciences
	science 1 gets changed to astrobiology science pack
	add ground sample to science 1
		
		make an exobiology tech 
			- realign farming to branch from exobiology
			- move lab equipment, ground sample,  seeded dish, petri dish and substrate dish
			
		move chlorine processing to t1

	--Science pack 2 changes
add seeded dish to science 2
replace ground sample with puffer eggs?, puffers?. some puffer related item

world gen changes
make changes so that getting a swamp tree is easyier or add a different way to get the needed seeds


	--((Automation changes))--
	
	all base game assembly machines will be limited to 1 ingrediant.
		might have to adjust this based on planned path and make it lvl 1 is 1. lvl 2 is 2 and lvl 3 is 3 ingrediants
	
	assembly machines will have energy source changes and automated factorys will have energy usage increased. base game ass 3 is at 375kw automated factory starts at 100kw for an extra .25 crafting speed
	
	assembly machine 1 will be steam powered and limited to 1 item tasks
	
	assembly machine 2 will come in 2 versions. 1 will be electric powered and require electric motors/engines. 2 will be gas (hydrocarbon most fuels) powered and require regular engines. 
	
		electric engines will tech will remove the prereq of regular motors as they are pretty much unrelated
			change around techs related to electric generation and transmission
				electric motors will be part of the first tech
					need to make a lub recipe availble early (probalbly from the farms)
				steam engines, py turbines and power equipment all fall under here
					nuclear and fusion will also branch off of here later in tree
					
	--(Fluids)--
	
	find all oil based fluids and sort out names and where they belong in the "distilation" tree
		naptha is duplicated and angels is a rename of petroleum gas
			petroleum gas icon is ethylene
